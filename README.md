What did you learn about how WordPress stores its files and data?
I learned that WordPress saves its files in folders, while all the website content and settings are stored in a database.

Which part was more complex: handling files or managing the database?
For me, managing the database was more difficult because it involves more steps and settings.

Why is version control useful for a WordPress project in an office setting?
Version control is helpful because it keeps track of changes and makes it easier for the team to work together without losing any progress.
